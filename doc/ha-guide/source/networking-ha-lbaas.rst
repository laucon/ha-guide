=======================
Run neutron LBaaS agent
=======================

Currently, no native feature is provided
to make the LBaaS agent highly available
using the default plug-in HAProxy.
A common way to make HAProxy highly available
is to use the VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol).
Unfortunately, this is not yet implemented
in the LBaaS HAProxy plug-in.

[TODO: update this section.]
