.. _neutron-metadata:

==========================
Run neutron metadata agent
==========================

No native feature is available
to make this service highly available.
At this time, the Active/Passive solution exists
to run the neutron metadata agent
in failover mode with Pacemaker.

[TODO: Update this information.
Can this service now be made HA in active/active mode
or do we need to pull in the instructions
to run this service in active/passive mode?]
