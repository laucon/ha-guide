  <title>Database</title>
    <para>The first step is installing the database that sits at the heart of
      the cluster. When we talk about high availability (HA), we talk about several
      databases (for redundancy) and a means to keep them synchronized. In
      this case, we choose the <application>MySQL</application> database,
      along with <application>Galera</application> plug-in for synchronous multi-master
      replication.</para>
    <para>The Galera Cluster plug-in is a multi-master Cluster based on
      synchronous replication. It is a high availability solution, which provides
      high system uptime, no data loss, and scalability
      for growth.</para>
    <note>
      <para>The choice of database is not a foregone conclusion; you are not
        required to use <application>MySQL</application>. It is, however, a
        fairly common choice in OpenStack installations, so we will cover it
        here.</para>
    </note>
    <note>
      <para>MySQL with Galera is by no means the only way to achieve database HA.
        MariaDB Galera Cluster (<link xlink:href="https://mariadb.org/">https://mariadb.org/</link>)
        and Percona XtraDB Cluster (<link xlink:href="http://www.percona.com/">http://www.percona.com/</link>)
        also work with Galera. You also have the option to use PostgreSQL, which
        has its own replication, or another database HA option.</para>
