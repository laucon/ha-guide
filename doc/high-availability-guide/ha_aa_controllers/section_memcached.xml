  <title>Memcached</title>
  <para>Most OpenStack services can use <application>Memcached</application> to
      store ephemeral data, such as tokens. Although <application>Memcached</application>
      does not support typical forms of redundancy, such as clustering, OpenStack
      services can use almost any number of instances by configuring multiple
      hostnames or IP addresses. The <application>Memcached</application>
      client implements hashing to balance objects among the instances. Failure of
      an instance only impacts a percentage of the objects and the client automatically
      removes it from the list of instances.</para>
  <para>To install and configure it, read the
    <link xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewStart">
    official documentation</link>.</para>
  <para>Memory caching is managed by oslo-incubator, so the way to use
    multiple memcached servers is the same for all projects.</para>
  <para>Example configuration with two hosts:</para>
  <programlisting>memcached_servers = controller1:11211,controller2:11211</programlisting>
  <para>By default, <literal>controller1</literal> handles the caching service
    but if the host goes down, <literal>controller2</literal> does the job. For
    more information about <application>Memcached</application> installation,
    see the <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/">
    OpenStack Cloud Administrator Guide</link>.</para>
